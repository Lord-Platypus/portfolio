## Personal Portfolio â€“ Flutter Web App

This project was built with **Flutter** to demonstrate my coding style and architectural approach.  
It follows **Clean Architecture** principles and uses **BLoC** for state management and **GoRouter**
for navigation.  
The app is **fully responsive**, adapting its layout seamlessly across different screen sizes.  
Currently, the backend responses are simulated with mock data, as this is still a **work in progress
**.  
I created this portfolio because most of my previous projects are under **NDA**, and I wanted to
showcase something public.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter (Web)
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture
- **State Management:** BLoC
- **Routing:** GoRouter
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

### Testing

A **single test** was implemented for **demonstration purposes**, to show how I structure and
approach testing in Flutter.  
Of course, in a production project, I would include **comprehensive test coverage** across layers
and features.

### Future Improvements

- Connect to a real backend
- Add animations and interactive elements
- Expand test coverage
